# NEC-condition-of-extra-dimensional-theory
These codes are used to test whether the extra-dimensional theory is consistent with observations of the universe. Related topics can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01143v2.
please use w0wa_check_all_points. For example 

k=6(string),

$Omega_0=0.7$(dark energy density today),

$zeta_0=\frac{\dot G}{G}=0.00614$

w0wa_check_all_points(0.7,0.00614,6)
you will obatin the result, black region is NEC area, and red line is DESI
