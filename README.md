# NEC-condition-of-extra-dimensional-theory
These codes are used to test whether the extra-dimensional theory is consistent with observations of the universe. Related topics can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01143v2.
We use k=6, which is 10-dimensional space-time. The current change of Newton's constant is 0.00614, and the dark energy density ratio is 0.7.
